Some files for experimenting with antenna patterns and placement.

The file force12-c3.nec represents a force 12 C3 antenna, with some simplifications made (constant diameter elements).

The spreadsheet has more information.

Anyone is welcome to use these, but they are unsupported and primarily for my experimentation.
